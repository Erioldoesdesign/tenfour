# Contributing design as an OSS contributor for TenFour

A comprehensive 'Sticker Sheet' or 'Design system' for the current TenFour UI & journey flow to be used for any designers looking to contribute UX, UI, Graphics, Illustration, Interaction Design or any visual design to TenFour as an OSS product.

This is an [Adobe XD file](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) and as such, will only work on Adobe XD software. A cloud doc is in development as of November 2019.
