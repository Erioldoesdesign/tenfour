## What is TenFour?

TenFour is an emergency check-in application for teams that unites multiple communication channels: SMS, email, desktop, mobile and chat. It's a team check-in system that gets answers when you need them most.

Responses can be collected from anyone, anytime, anywhere by SMS, email, the TenFour app and slack so there is no device type dependency.

It can securely store team info with multiple points of contact, all synced securely via encrypted transport.

It will support multiple admin and user roles, so that your team only sees what you want.

Users can Add contacts to a group so one can check-in with multiple people with the push of a button.

TenFour has modules that work with telecom carriers around the world (SMS currently in US, UK, CA, KE).

## Why do we need TenFour?

Crises are growing in the world.

In the last two decades, there has been an increase of human-made attacks globally, while the majority are concentrated in just a few countries, there were attacks in 106 countries in 2017. Though overall mortality is low from these attacks, from our experience, they still require tools to coordinate to maintain duty of care for your team.

Extreme weather related events are increasing quickly, causing significant economic damage and casualties. All science shows that these extreme events will only increase in the coming years.

Crises are a big deal for organizations, as in the US, even with a robust 1st responder and insurance ecosystem, 25% of small businesses don’t reopen, and it is worse elsewhere in the world where SMEs have lower insurance rates for their assets.


## TenFour test case

We’ve tested this in real life with a handful of organizations, community projects, volunteer groups and field staff and we’ve already seen it has been absolutely necessary.

[AkiraChix](http://akirachix.com/) is one of our sister organizations in Kenya that teaches women in Nairobi’s slums how to code and places them into tech jobs.
During the election in Kenya this last summer, violence broke out in the slums. The manager of AkiraChix immediately checked-in with her students over TenFour. The 25 girls texted, emailed and responded to check-in notifications. In just a matter of minutes, AkiraChix knew that their students were safe.

## Contributing Code

TenFour became Open Source in August 2019. It was previous a closed repository and not an Open Source tool due to SMS vendor information being tied to [Ushahidi](ushahidi.com) who built the tool over the last 4 years.

As such the process for contributing is a work in progress and will be updated here.
